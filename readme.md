## Solving💪🏻 Mountain Car🚙 Continuous problem using Proximal Policy Optimization - Reinforcement Learning

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular state-of-the-art Policy Gradient Method. It is supposed to learn relatively quickly and stable while being much simpler to tune, compared to other state-of-the-art approaches like TRPO, DDPG or A3C. This makes PPO often the first choice when it comes to solving a problem for the first time. PPO strongly builds on Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).
